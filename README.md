# Gatsby

Gatsby is a video sharing platform based on peer-to-peer file distribution
provided by IPFS and WebRTC.

General documentation can be found [here](./docs/README.md) whereas
documentation for components can be found in `README` files in the directories
they are defined in. 

## Building

To build the repository, simply use `yarn build` while in the project's base
directory. This should build each package in turn. To then launch the site,
you can use `yarn dev` to initiate a development server that supports
hot-reloading, or `yarn start` to run an optimized build.

Spring is the story of a shepherd girl and her dog, who face ancient spirits in order to continue the cycle of life. This poetic and visually stunning short film was written and directed by Andy Goralczyk, inspired by his childhood in the mountains of Germany.

The Spring team used the development version of Blender 2.80 for the entire production, before the software was in official Beta even. As for all of Blender’s Open Movies, the entire production process and all its source files are being shared on the production platform Blender Cloud.
